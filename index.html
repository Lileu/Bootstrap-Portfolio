            <p>Hi, I’m Lisa and welcome to my first bit of homework on my coding “journey”.</p>
            <p>My background is in Finance/Economics and I had been working at a Wealth Management
                company in Finance
                and Accounting roles for most of my career before I learned what a Business Analyst
                was and thought,
                ‘That sounds like a pretty sweet gig, I could do that!’. So, I started getting
                involved in projects and
                managed to score some business analysis secondments within Finance that gave me
                exposure to
                things like data analysis/reporting, process improvement, workflow automation etc..
                That was enough of a
                taster to affirm that IT was where I wanted to be. </p>
            <p>I was approached about a Business Analyst role in IT for a smaller Wealth Management
                company two and a
                half years ago, and I just went for it. Best move ever (apart from moving from
                Perth). </p>
            <p>Moving from Finance to IT has proved to be a massive learning curve for me. The
                culture, values, personalities, lingo,
                way of working, way of thinking, are all so different from Finance. In my view,
                everything is an upgrade
                though and I would never go back. Every work day is different now. I get paid to
                solve
                problems and build cool stuff with brilliant, supportive and hilarious kids. I’m
                learning new things all
                the time and it doesn’t stop. </p>
            <p>One side effect of working with awesome Devs is that knowing first-hand what they can
                do/make, and I want
                to do it too. Just as I felt when I realised I wanted to be a BA, I know it’s a
                sweet gig and I can do
                it. So here I am, being challenged, learning new skills, building cool stuff, and
                loving it.</p>
